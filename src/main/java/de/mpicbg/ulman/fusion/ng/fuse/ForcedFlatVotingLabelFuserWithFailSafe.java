	 * voxel should appear in the final fused segment. Despite the weights for the
	 * inputs are given, here **every input is treated with the same (flat) weight**.
	 * The output image is then thresholded with this.minAcceptableWeight, which one
	 * should set beforehand with, e.g., setMinAcceptableWeight(), and is made binary.
	 *
	 * This process may fail, e.g., when there is not enough images to accumulate
	 * over the threshold, which is detected and in which case the "emergency"
	 * (fail safe) routine is executed.
	 * Here, the {@link FailSafeInsertor#clearAndInsertBestWeightMarker} is used
	 * which **will use the weights**. So the weights are considered only for the
	 * fail safe operation, and are **not** considered during the voting itself.
