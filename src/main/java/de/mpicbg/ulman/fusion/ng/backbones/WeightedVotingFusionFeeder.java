/**
 * This class essentially takes care of the IO burden. One provides it with
 * a weighted voting fusion algorithm and a "formatted" job specification
 * as a list of strings:
 *
 * image1_asPathAndFilename, image1_asWeightAsRealNumber,
 * image2_asPathAndFilename, image2_asWeightAsRealNumber,
 * ...
 * imageN_asPathAndFilename, imageN_asWeightAsRealNumber,
 * imageMarker_PathAndFilename, ThresholdAsRealNumber,
 * imageOutput_asPathAndFilename
 *
 * The class then reads the respective images, complements them with
 * extracted weights and the threshold, calls the fusion algorithm,
 * and saves the output image.
