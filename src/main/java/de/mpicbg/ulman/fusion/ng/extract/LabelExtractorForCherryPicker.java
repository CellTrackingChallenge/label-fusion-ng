 * This shall be achieved _without_ modifying the service/backend framework around, and this framework
 * is not ready for this. But since the LabelExtractor object is carried over from the generic
 * framework's fusing code (that iteratively calls the LabelPicker), this implementation of the
 * LabelExtractor was hijacked...
