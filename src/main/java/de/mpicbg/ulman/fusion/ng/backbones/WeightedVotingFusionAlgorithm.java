/**
 * Specialized variant of a fusion algorithm that requires weight per every input image,
 * and a threshold to define the minimal necessary cumulation of weights to include a voxel
 * into the fused output. The implementation should follow this pattern:
 *
 * O[x] = SUM_i=indicesOfInputImages w(i)*I(i)[x] >= T ? 1 : 0
 *
 * where
 * O[x] is the indicator (binary) image output value at position 'x',
 * I(i)[x] is the i-th indicator image input value at position 'x',
 * w(i) is the weight associated with the i-th input image, and
 * T is the said minimal necessary cumulation of weights.
