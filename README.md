Welcome

This is a repository with Java tools in the form of [Fiji](http://fiji.sc) plugins related to the [Cell Tracking Challenge](http://www.celltrackingchallenge.net). In particular, a generic fusion framework is hosted here. The framework offers various ways to, in fact, convert set of tracking markers into a segmentation mask by combining (selecting some and fusing the selected) from given multiple segmentation results. The `-ng` suggests this is a next generation of the [original BIC fusion algorithm](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCVW_2018/papers/11134/Akbas_Automatic_Fusion_of_Segmentation_and_Tracking_Labels_ECCVW_2018_paper.pdf).
